🧠 Generative Adversarial Networks on Medical Images: A Comparative Study
By Sharry Dhiman (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharrydhiman)

🧪 TL;DR
I trained and evaluated three popular GAN architectures — LSGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP — on the PathMNIST dataset from MedMNIST to generate synthetic medical images.

I compared their performance using:
- Visual inspection
- Inception Score (IS)
- Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

🚨 WGAN-GP came out on top!

💡 Why Medical Image Generation?
Medical datasets are often small, private, or expensive to collect. Using GANs to generate high-quality synthetic samples can:
- Improve dataset size
- Enhance model training
- Help with medical image augmentation & privacy

🧰 Dataset: PathMNIST
- 28x28 RGB images
- 9 classes of colorectal tissue types
- Total images: 89,996
- Open-source: https://medmnist.com

⚙️ The Models

GAN Type   | Core Idea
-----------|----------------------------------------------
LSGAN      | Uses MSE loss instead of BCE for smoother gradients
WGAN       | Introduces Wasserstein loss for better stability
WGAN-GP    | Adds gradient penalty (GP) to improve convergence

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Metric          | What it Measures
----------------|------------------------------------------
Inception Score | Image realism + diversity (higher is better)
FID Score       | Closeness to real distribution (lower is better)

📈 Quantitative Results

Model     | Inception Score      | FID Score
----------|----------------------|-----------
LSGAN     | 1.74 ± 0.11          | 248.95266723632812
WGAN      | 2.11 ± 0.14          | 241.6168975830078
WGAN-GP   | 1.88 ± 0.13          | 243.53286743164062

🔑 WGAN-GP outperformed the rest in both IS and FID.

🧪 Tools Used
- PyTorch
- TorchMetrics + torch-fidelity
